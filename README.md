## Exchange

In Exchange, you play as a new practitioner in the Forms, training to join your planets' elite peacekeeping force. However, upon discovering the depths of corruption with your ranks, will you be able to fight your way out of the same facility that taught you everything you know?

## The Forms

An ancient practice directly manipulating force vectors, the Forms can only be controlled with strict, choreographed movements. You've always found the old ways tiresome, though, and have developed your own practice in secret, based on your ability to track enemy positions with the Mark.

Your Composure measures your resilience against enemy attacks. When your Composure is equal to or higher than your Health, all incoming damage goes to your Composure first. When your Health is higher than your Composure, you take Health damage until your Composure is equal to your Health, at which point any remaining damage goes to your Composure.

### Form 1

A defensive Form. Successfully intercepting enemy attacks in the active stage of this Form rewards you with Composure.

### Form 2

An offensive Form. Attacks in this Form damage your enemy's Composure. A fully Decomposed enemy is able to be Marked.

Spend your Composure wisely to dash out of harm's way.

### Form 3

A levitating Form, typically unused in combat. You have found a way to exchange the potential energy granted in this Form to rain destruction on Marked enemies, giving you an upper hand against your more well-trained colleagues.
